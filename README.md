* Fastest assembly code generation library
1. Compile time instruction opcode generation with inline
2. No heap memory allocations
3. Do not use exceptions

* Some advanced features
1. Compile time check for instructions syntax
2. Support replace some instruction operands after first pass
3. Available instruction set can be configured to find not available instruction in compile time
4. Fast measure of instructions size before write them

* No external dependencies
1. Use only C++ standart libraries for core functionality

## Support compilers 

* Visual Studio 2015 (Update 3)
